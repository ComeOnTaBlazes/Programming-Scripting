# Programming-Scripting
James Hannon's work for the programming & scripting module
All codes are not complete, I had intended to go back and update a lot of the earlier codes with better comments, and overall improve the actual programs.

I have included 2 programs for week 6's problem to do with squares as I did it in 2 different ways. I quite liked the simplicity of one of the methods.

Most user scripts with user inputs should have some form of exception handling included, I really only got around to tackling this late and included it in one of the sets (wk7counte).
